# Code of Conduct

## Illuminating Character

This project exists to showcase, nurture, and elevate the best in each of us. That means we put **people first**, always — their character, their growth, and their right to belong.

## What We Stand For

- **Respect over ego** – We challenge ideas, not people.
- **Real over perfect** – Be honest, be raw, be you. There’s no mask required.
- **Contribution with care** – Whether it’s a PR, a comment, or feedback — make it count. Don’t waste someone’s time or energy.
- **Progress through purpose** – Every line of code should serve our mission: connecting humanity to technology without erasing what makes us human.

## Not Welcome Here

- Bigotry, hate, or toxicity in any form.
- Gatekeeping or elitism — we're not here to flex credentials, we're here to build.
- Trolling, spamming, or derailing conversations.

## What Happens if You Cross the Line

Privately, you will be invited to leave.

## Final Word

We are not robots in the Matrix
We are talented people with ideas
The spirit of this is to illuminate charater, not degrade it. Please act accordingly.
Any behavior and language counter to the mission will be met with swift action.

We illuminate character, not degrade it.
